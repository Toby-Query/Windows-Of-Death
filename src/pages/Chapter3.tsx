      <h1>Chapter 3: Some Stuff to End The Day</h1>
      <p>
        The truth is, most of my day had been a tedious affair, and I found
        myself eagerly looking forward to the solace of my home, even if it
        meant succumbing to a different kind of boredom. As I made my way back,
        my only desire was to retreat to the refuge of my room, where I could
        escape the monotony that had plagued me throughout the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inevitably, my mom would inquire about how my first day at school went.
        However, I had already decided to shut myself off from any conversation
        regarding my less-than-stellar experiences. I planned to hide away,
        seeking solace within the walls of my room and pretending as though the
        day had never happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, did I forget to mention the uniforms my mom had bought for us? They
        were, to put it mildly, quite peculiar and had a knack for making us
        look funny and, well, stupid. The details of this wardrobe blunder were
        skipped in the previous chapter, but it wasn't without consequences. I
        became the target of ridicule on my very first day, subjected to the
        mocking laughter of my peers. The weight of their jests lingered, and I
        couldn't help but wonder how the rest of the term would unfold.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being the centre of attention, especially in such a derisive manner, was
        not my preference. It made me feel uneasy, as if a swarm of imaginary
        insects were crawling beneath my skin. It gave me what Rajesh from The
        Big Bang Theory would call the "gibby gibbies," a sensation that left me
        desperate to escape the spotlight and find solace in the shadows.
      </p>
      <p>
        After school, I sought the guidance of my older brother, as I didn't
        want to risk getting lost on my first day. Navigating the intricacies of
        public transportation was a foreign concept to me, so I turned to
        someone with more experience. I found him near Greenhouse, a local shop
        renowned for its delicious vetkoeks, the South African equivalent of
        doughnuts. My brother was in the company of his friends, and to my
        surprise, he seemed genuinely kind towards me. He even offered to buy me
        a vetkoek as a gesture of goodwill. However, I wasn't accustomed to him
        behaving this way, so I politely declined, claiming to be already full.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we arrived home, his demeanour underwent a sudden transformation. He
        became distant and cold, and his words pierced through me like daggers.
        "Don't ever do that again. I don't associate with kids. In fact, pretend
        like we don't know each other at all when I'm around my friends. I don't
        have a dumb brother." Did his words hurt? Not even a little. I had grown
        accustomed to such harsh treatment. It was the familiar sting of his
        words that lulled me to sleep on most nights. Paradoxically, it was his
        previous display of kindness that sent shivers down my spine. There was
        something unsettling about his temporary benevolence, a stark contrast
        to the norm, and it filled me with an inexplicable sense of unease.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alone in the confines of my room, where solitude reigned supreme, I
        sought solace in the familiar ritual of introspection. It was in these
        moments that I turned to my most trusted confidante, my guardian angel,
        my beloved sister Lani. Grasping my phone, I dialled her number and
        eagerly awaited her comforting voice. I poured out the events of my day,
        recounting the encounters with the so-called witches and the unsettling
        behaviour of my brother. And as always, she fulfilled her role as a
        patient listener, offering her insightful commentary.
      </p>
      <p>
        But deep down, did I truly believe the words of wisdom emanating from
        the other end of the phone call? Well, I feigned conviction. How could I
        place absolute faith in someone whose profession involved persuading
        individuals that their perceived reality was but an illusion? Yes,
        that's right—Lani was a psychologist, and I had been her patient long
        before she embarked on her own journey in the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It had to be someone. Someone had to bear the burden of hallucinations,
        endure ridicule, and have him as a brother. Unfortunate as it may be,
        the universe chose you. But fear not, for you are the one who possesses
        the strength to withstand it all. With the passage of time, your
        discomfort will fade away," reassured my sister, her words transcending
        her role as a psychologist. Those words, spoken by my sister, held the
        greatest solace the world could offer me. It was enough, for it emanated
        from my source of peace, my other half, and it resonated deep within my
        soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        In various Asian cultures, there exists a belief that the gods have
        intricately tied a sacred thread onto every living person, symbolizing
        their connections to others. This mystical thread, known as the red
        thread of fate, is said to be an unbreakable bond that links individuals
        together, often in ways that transcend time, place, and circumstance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The red thread is believed to be a manifestation of destiny, weaving the
        lives of those who are meant to meet and impact each other's journeys.
        It is said that regardless of the paths they traverse or the obstacles
        they face, the thread will guide them towards one another, ensuring
        their fates remain forever intertwined.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the concept of the red thread of fate is commonly associated with
        destined lovers who are believed to be bound by the thread until they
        unite in marriage, it can also represent other profound connections. In
        my case, I use the metaphorical comparison of the red thread to
        illustrate the deep bond I share with my sister, Lani. Our connection
        transcends the bounds of mere siblinghood, resembling the intertwined
        destinies often attributed to the red thread of fate.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, in embracing the belief in the red thread of fate, I find solace in
        knowing that despite the challenges and uncertainties of life, my
        connection to Lani remains steadfast. It is a reminder that our
        destinies are forever intertwined, and the red thread continues to bind
        us together in a unique and unbreakable way.

        As I lay in bed, preparing to drift off to sleep, I began my nightly
        routine of reciting everything I had learned throughout the week. This
        ritual not only helped me to keep my memory sharp but also served as a
        reminder of my own strength—the power of my mind and the knowledge that
        propelled me towards success.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it was only my first day at secondary school, I had already been
        studying ahead during the holidays, eager to stay ahead of the curve.
        Reciting my learnings before sleep was not just a voluntary act; it was
        compulsory for me, a personal commitment I made to myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I conclude this chapter, I want to mention that the productive
        habit approach is just one of several strategies to achieving success.
        In subsequent chapters, I will explore other approaches and share
        additional insights that have shaped my journey thus far.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, let me quote something I got from the Marco Polo series: “Kung
        Fu. It means ‘supreme skill from hard work’. A great poet has reached
        Kung Fu. The painter, the calligrapher, they can be said to have Kung
        Fu. Even the cook, the one who sweeps steps, or a masterful servant can
        have Kung Fu. Practice. Preparation. Endless repetition. Until your mind
        is weary, and your bones ache. Until you’re too tired to sweat, too
        wasted to breathe. That is the way, that is the only way one acquires
        Kung Fu.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Tell me, what have you learned today? Nothing. What have you learned
        this week? Nothing. What have you learned this month? Nothing. What did
        you learn yesterday? Nothing. It was gone, it was all gone. My brain had
        performed a coup d’état. I could not remember a thing. Perhaps my day
        was just too boring, I tell myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I lay there, waiting to wake up so I can wonder at what moment I fell
        asleep. As I waited for the bus, a train came in its place. This is the
        night it began, the slowly increasing intensity of sound. Imagine
        someone drawing closer to your ear while screaming their lungs out.
        That’s what it felt like, except that it sounded more like it was
        hundreds of people. And unlike the scenario, you can’t snap at the
        person or cover your ears because it’s in your head. Do you know that
        sweet voice in your head that’s very fluent in language? I heard
        hundreds of them, fluent in screaming and very depressing. An entire
        horde was screaming, each wanting its voice to be heard. I decided to
        call them the Screaming Horde.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the day, I reached three unsettling conclusions that left
        me grappling with the newfound changes in my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, my hearing had taken an inexplicable leap in sensitivity. It
        was as if a veil had been lifted, granting me the ability to perceive
        even the faintest of sounds. While this might sound like a superpower
        from a comic book, in reality, it felt like a weakness. The world around
        me became a minefield of auditory bombardment, overwhelming my senses.
        Doctors might call it Hyperacusis, a condition where everyday sounds
        become painfully amplified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, I noticed a disturbing shift in my memory. It seemed that
        certain fragments of my life had vanished into thin air, leaving gaps in
        my recollection. I found myself struggling to recall important details
        and moments that were once etched into my mind. It was as if someone had
        discreetly edited my mental archives, erasing crucial data. No, there
        were no mysterious agents in black suits involved, just a disconcerting
        sense of loss.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, and perhaps most distressingly, I discovered that even in the
        absence of sound, silence could scream out to me for help. It was an
        eerie paradox—a void of sound that carried an overwhelming weight, a
        silent plea for attention. How does one silence the silence itself? The
        question reverberated in my mind, haunting me as I searched for answers.
