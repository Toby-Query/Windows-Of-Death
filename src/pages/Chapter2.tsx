      <h1>Chapter 2: First Day of School</h1>
      <p>
        As we made our way to Chibase Secondary School, my older brother took it
        upon himself to regale us with tales of its grandeur and the
        intimidating figures that lurked within its walls. He painted a vivid
        picture of a sprawling campus teeming with students and an abundance of
        ferocious teachers. One name that sent shivers down our spines was
        Power, a teacher feared by both newbies and seasoned students alike. The
        mere mention of his name was enough to make even the bravest tremble.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then there was 3B, a teacher renowned for his strict discipline. Three
        rods from him and you remain straight for the rest of your life. Such
        was the level of discipline and rigidity that echoed through the
        corridors of Chibase.
      </p>
      <p>
        And who could forget Principal Tseles, a figure of authority whose
        reputation preceded him. Legends were whispered about him, tales of his
        uncompromising nature and his penchant for doling out punishments with
        swift and unrelenting justice. I heard stories of a day when he punished
        over 2,000 pupils, a testament to his unwavering commitment to
        discipline. There were even whispers of teachers engaging in physical
        altercations with students, resulting in a tally of blows that left a
        lasting impression on the school's history.
      </p>
      <p>
        These stories were like threads woven into the fabric of the school's
        lore, passed down from generation to generation. Each tale carried a
        sense of mystery and intrigue, leaving us eager to experience the school
        firsthand. The stories are many, it’s the time that’s limited.
      </p>
      <p>
        As our transport arrived, my brother's enthusiastic storytelling about
        Chibase came to an abrupt halt. We approached a Quantum taxi with the
        distinctive code 8 (Mukumbani) emblazoned on its side. It was a vehicle
        unlike any I had ridden before. In my previous school, located on the
        opposite side of town, we rarely used Quantum taxis for transportation.
        So, stepping into this unfamiliar mode of transport added an extra layer
        of excitement to our already eventful day.
      </p>
      <p>
        I couldn't help but notice the driver's name displayed on the front
        door, but my brother simply referred to him as Fanie. Inside the taxi, I
        saw others like us, donned in the same blue shirts and grey trousers
        that marked us as students of Chibase. However, they wore an air of
        familiarity and experience that set them apart from us, the newcomers.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we settled into our seats, my brother effortlessly engaged in
        conversations with our fellow passengers. It was clear that he had
        already established a sense of camaraderie among his peers, a testament
        to his outgoing nature and ability to connect with others. I observed
        their interactions, quietly absorbing the dynamics of this new social
        circle I found myself in.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sight of my oldest brother mingling effortlessly with our fellow
        passengers in the taxi left me in a state of disbelief. How could
        anyone, in their right mind or otherwise, find joy in his presence?
        Rasikhinkha had always been a challenging figure to like, intentionally
        putting up barriers to prevent others from getting close. His aloof
        demeanor and superiority complex made it difficult for me to understand
        why my younger brother, Gope, idolized him so fervently. At times, I
        couldn't help but wonder if Gope had a peculiar kind of brain fungus,
        distorting his perception of reality. But as I glanced around the taxi
        and witnessed the seemingly universal admiration for Rasikhinkha, I
        couldn't help but question whether I was the one who stood apart from
        the infected masses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon enough, Rasikhinkha began asserting his dominance over the
        unsuspecting newcomer, mercilessly forcing him out of the back seat. It
        was a classic display of his power over the so-called "newbies,".
        Witnessing this scene unfold, I couldn't help but feel a pang of
        sympathy for the hapless victim. He was just another casualty in the
        wake of my brother's overbearing personality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seated beside Rasikhinkha, however, was a strikingly tall and beautiful
        young woman. By the standards of aesthetics, there is an undeniable
        allure to a tall figure, and she epitomized this concept flawlessly. It
        is safe to assume that she possessed an artistic charm that captivated
        the eyes and stirred the imagination. My brother, never one to miss an
        opportunity to showcase his supposed charms, called out to me, urging me
        to take a look as he attempted to enchant this young lady. It was as if
        he wanted to demonstrate that encounters with such captivating beings
        would become a regular occurrence in the next five years of my life, a
        stark contrast to the monotony of my previous experiences in primary
        school.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, our perspectives on such matters diverged significantly. While
        Rasikhinkha saw nothing more than an opportunity for conquest and
        physical intimacy, I saw a work of art waiting to be appreciated and
        captured on paper. It was the intricate beauty of the human form that
        fascinated me, the lines and curves that inspired my artistic
        sensibilities. In the realm of human anatomy, my eyes found their truest
        passion. I marveled at the intricate details and delicate balance of
        proportions that made each individual unique. It was through this lens
        that I viewed the world, finding beauty in the subtlest of nuances.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the taxi made its way through the bustling streets, it seemed to have
        an uncanny ability to accommodate an ever-increasing number of
        passengers. Beyond the designated passenger limit, the vehicle became a
        crowded space, filled with a diverse array of individuals. Though this
        was a new experience for me, the nonchalant expressions on the faces of
        my fellow passengers indicated that this was a common occurrence.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we embarked on this journey, the fare had already been established at
        R200, considering we were halfway through the month. However, there was
        someone eager to test the boundaries and attempt to negotiate a lower
        price. A man boldly proposed that the fare should be reduced to R150,
        hoping to strike a bargain. Yet, his attempts at haggling were met with
        resistance, as the driver remained firm in maintaining the agreed-upon
        fare.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the taxi rolled closer to Chibase Secondary School, my initial
        expectations clashed with the reality that lay before me. I couldn't
        deny the size of the school, its sprawling campus standing as a
        testament to its prestige. However, nestled within the rural landscape,
        a different set of features came into focus. The air was thick with
        dust, an ever-present companion that seemed to settle on every surface.
        The vibrant colors that might have adorned the surroundings were muted,
        tinged with a layer of earthy particles. It was a reminder that beauty
        can exist in unexpected places, but it was difficult to fully appreciate
        it amidst the veil of pollution. The overpopulation added another layer
        of complexity to the scene. The school buzzed with activity, teeming
        with students from various backgrounds, each carving their path through
        the labyrinth of hallways and classrooms. While the sheer number of
        individuals might have overwhelmed some, I couldn't help but find
        fascination in the diverse tapestry that unfolded before me. Amidst the
        commotion, there was a distinctive feature that caught my attention—an
        alarm system. Designed with careful thought and attention to detail, it
        possessed an element of beauty in its functionality. However, the
        pollution that blanketed the surroundings tarnished the overall
        impression. It was a bittersweet encounter, appreciating the ingenuity
        while acknowledging the harsh realities that tainted the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I entered the school grounds, I observed a curious phenomenon
        unfolding before my eyes. The trees, with their weathered barks and
        branches reaching out like eager arms, seemed to have an inherent
        understanding of their destination. They navigated the bustling
        pathways, each tree finding its designated spot, ready to commence their
        day of growth and learning. On the other hand, the younger, more vibrant
        saplings stood in a cluster, uncertain and disoriented in each other's
        presence. It was a visual representation of the blind leading the blind,
        a metaphor for our collective journey through the unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this context, the concept of knowledge became a defining factor. It
        all came down to who had absorbed the most useful information, who had
        listened intently to the stories shared by their siblings and peers. If
        we were to pool together the fragments of knowledge we possessed, we
        could hypothetically create a comprehensive map of the entire school,
        guiding us through its labyrinthine corridors with ease.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in practicality, I faced a personal dilemma. I am an introvert,
        one who experiences an inexplicable aversion to socializing. It
        manifests itself as shyness, an internal force that restrains my desire
        to engage with others. It presents a simple answer to complex questions
        like "should I make friends or not?" Why make friends if I am unable to
        truly connect with them? Such thoughts weighed heavily on my mind as I
        navigated the uncharted waters of the school.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, I held a glimmer of hope that an extrovert, with their outgoing
        nature and ease in forging connections, might adopt me into their social
        circle. Until that moment arrives, I resign myself to going with the
        flow, embracing the rhythm of the school and the unfolding chapters of
        my life within its walls. Perhaps in time, I will find my own balance,
        learning to navigate the complexities of relationships and discovering
        my place within this vibrant community.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first time in forever…. Nah, that’s just a line in a song. For
        the first time in my life, I found myself immersed in a cacophony of
        chaos. The jubilant celebrations and animated conversations of my fellow
        students, who were elated to have reached the secondary level, merged
        into a dissonant symphony that assaulted my ears. It was as if 400
        voices had conspired to shatter my eardrums, leaving me overwhelmed and
        disoriented. The once cheerful atmosphere morphed into an unpleasant
        amalgamation of noise, reverberating through the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that moment, the realization hit me with the force of a sledgehammer.
        I understood the concept of change, the notion that it encompasses both
        positive and negative aspects. Just as someone had once told me, a
        change that is purely positive invites the emergence of a negative force
        from the depths of nothingness.
      </p>
      <p>
        I couldn't help but attribute my newfound sensitivity to sound to the
        encounter with the witch earlier that day. The touch of her cursed hand
        on my ear seemed to have unleashed an unexpected consequence upon me.
        Let’s see if I can come up with a line to mark that event in my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. She placed her cursed hand on my ear, and my life has been cursed
        ever since. 2. She placed her cursed hand on my ear, and that’s where
        all my troubles began.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I had no scientific evidence or expert opinion to confirm
        whether I was truly cursed or not, the mere fact that a witch had cast
        her gaze upon me was enough to ignite a lingering sense of unease. It
        was as if the veil of the ordinary had been lifted, revealing a world
        teeming with unseen forces and impending trials.
      </p>
      <p>
        The piercing sound of the second alarm jarred me from my thoughts, its
        ominous tone resonating through the air. It seemed as though its sole
        purpose was to unsettle my senses and send a chill down my spine. The
        alarm served as a reminder that it was time for the assembly, a fact
        gleaned from the murmurs of those around me. However, the question
        lingered in my mind: Where exactly was one supposed to go in this
        labyrinthine and unfamiliar school?
      </p>
      <p>
        In the face of uncertainty, society had ingrained in us a simple
        solution: follow the mass. The wisdom of the mass is considered
        infallible, and it is believed that its collective actions held the key
        to truth and righteousness. If the mass deems a path to be correct, then
        it must be so, even if it appears to be flawed or misguided. The notion
        that the majority's opinion inherently carries weight and validity had
        been instilled in us from the very moment we took our first steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I followed the swarm of students moving in unison, their footsteps
        echoing through the corridors. It was a sea of bodies, all flowing in
        the same direction with a shared purpose. As I merged into the current,
        I couldn't help but ponder the power and influence of conformity. It was
        both comforting and unsettling to surrender my individuality to the
        collective will, trusting that the multitude knew the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sight before me was both awe-inspiring and overwhelming. A vast
        expanse of paved open field stretched out, adorned with a stage that
        seemed to dwarf any I had ever laid eyes upon. The assembly area was
        akin to a bustling anthill, with students converging from every
        direction, their movements synchronized as if driven by a common
        purpose. I estimated their numbers to be around 2,000, a multitude that
        filled my mind, eyes, and ears with a sense of magnitude. Or perhaps my
        estimation was influenced by the stories my brother had shared, painting
        a picture of a grand assembly that lived up to its reputation.
      </p>
      <p>
        On that day, I found myself positioned in the front row, a spot that
        would come to evoke mixed feelings throughout my secondary school years.
        My initial rationale for choosing this vantage point was practicality—it
        offered a clearer view due to the advantage of height. Yet, there was
        also an inherent desire within me to stand out, to be visible among the
        crowd. I believed that being noticed and standing apart from the masses
        defined who I was. It was an image I had cultivated about myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as I surveyed the sea of faces behind me, the imposing stage
        before me, and the surrounding environment, a wave of realization washed
        over me. I began to question my former convictions. Did I truly desire
        the spotlight? Did I genuinely long to tower above others? Did I
        genuinely wish to occupy the front and center stage of attention? The
        answer, it seemed, was a resounding "no."
      </p>
      <p>
        In that moment of introspection, my perspective shifted. I yearned to
        blend into the mass, to become a mere face among the multitude,
        invisible and unnoticed. The allure of being average, of residing in the
        realm of anonymity, tugged at my heart. I craved an existence where
        people would glance at me and remain ignorant of my identity. The desire
        to shed the spotlight and embrace the comfort of obscurity revealed
        itself to be an unexplored facet of my being.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the assembly commenced, I stepped back, figuratively and literally,
        allowing myself to merge with the masses, to relinquish the desire for
        prominence. I embraced the ordinary, embracing the beauty of anonymity,
        and embarking on a quest to discover the profound meaning that lies
        within the hearts and minds of those around me.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that transformative moment, I discovered a new facet of my identity—a
        persona perfectly suited to my inclinations and aspirations. I
        christened it the OP, short for the Observer Personality. This newfound
        role resonated deeply within me, offering a sense of purpose and clarity
        that had eluded me before. I realized that I was not meant to be the
        protagonist, nor did I fit the mould of a villain or even a tritagonist.
        Instead, I embraced my role as the observer—the one who stands on the
        sidelines, keenly attuned to the ebb and flow of life's unfolding
        stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Life, I realized, is akin to a game—a complex interplay of choices,
        challenges, and triumphs. And while I am not the master of this game,
        nor the one who cleans up its aftermath, I am the one who watches
        intently, taking in every twist and turn. I observe as individuals like
        you navigate the labyrinthine pathways of existence, grappling with the
        complexities, succumbing to folly, forging alliances, encountering
        betrayal, experiencing success, and revelling in their achievements. I
        witness the tapestry of human experiences, woven by the choices and
        actions of those who venture forth.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the game reaches its culmination, whether in triumph or defeat, it
        is then that I take my place as the silent chronicler. I sit down, pen
        in hand, and inscribe the opening lines of a new chapter. I become the
        narrator, the novelist who weaves the narratives that shape the
        collective tapestry of human existence. From the vantage point of the
        observer, I bear witness to the intricate dance of lives unfolding,
        offering a unique perspective on the human condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this role, I find solace and purpose—a deep-seated fulfilment that
        comes from immersing myself in the lives and stories of others. The
        Observer Personality allows me to contribute to the rich tapestry of
        human experience, capturing the essence of the human spirit and sharing
        it with the world. It is through the lens of observation that I derive
        meaning, offering insights and reflections that resonate with the hearts
        and minds of those who partake in the grand theatre of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, as I embrace the mantle of the Observer Personality, I dedicate
        myself to the art of watching, listening, and understanding. I shall
        bear witness to your triumphs and tribulations, your joys and sorrows,
        and with each chapter that unfolds, I shall endeavour to paint a vivid
        portrait of the extraordinary beauty that resides within the ordinary.
        For it is through observation that I find my purpose, illuminating the
        threads that connect us all in the grand tapestry of existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, that’s just an outline of what I decided to do with the rest of
        my secondary life. That’s who I want to be, a novelist. If you are
        reading this, then you know how my life turned out.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I observed the teachers making their grand entrance onto the stage, I
        couldn't help but feel a sense of curiosity and intrigue. Who were these
        individuals who held such authority and influence over our educational
        journey? The names that echoed through the air - Principal Tseles,
        Power, and 3B - carried an air of mystery and significance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Principal Tseles, the head of the school, stood tall and exuded an aura
        of command. His reputation preceded him, as his name was known far and
        wide. The stories that circulated about him varied, from tales of strict
        discipline to acts of compassion and guidance. He was the orchestrator
        of this grand educational symphony, the one responsible for shaping the
        course of our academic lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Power, on the other hand, was a figure shrouded in intrigue. Despite
        never appearing at the assembly, his name reverberated through the
        whispers of the students. He seemed to possess an authority that
        transcended the confines of the stage, rumoured to be at odds with the
        principal. It can’t be a complete school body without some drama, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        A figure dressed in a resplendent purple suit stepped up to the podium,
        assuming control of the microphone and extending a warm greeting to the
        assembled learners. He held the esteemed position of the day's pastor,
        earning him the affectionate nickname "Bruce Man" from the crowd. As he
        began to speak, his voice resonated with a distinct accent reminiscent
        of his Zimbabwean origins. However, it wasn't just his accent that
        captivated the attention of the students; there was an undeniable power
        in his words that silenced the bustling chatter of the grade 9s, 10s,
        11s, and 12s. It was as if his voice possessed a commanding authority,
        effortlessly cutting through the noise and commanding rapt attention.
        This man, adorned in his vibrant purple attire, stirred a familiar
        recognition within me. Could it be anyone other than Chibase's revered
        mathematician, renowned for his brilliance and charismatic presence?
      </p>
      <p>
        The hushed silence that enveloped the crowd in the presence of Bruce Man
        carried an unmistakable undercurrent of fear. It wasn't just a mere
        display of respect; there was an unsettling aura that gripped the
        learners, as if they were held captive by a palpable sense of
        apprehension. It was as though the weight of their gaze was not solely
        directed at the man in purple but also at the bald figure in the brown
        suit, who observed the students with an intensity akin to a predator
        stalking its prey. While not an expert in ornithology, I couldn't help
        but draw a parallel between the hawk's piercing focus and the bald man's
        unwavering vigilance. Their combined presence seemed to permeate the
        atmosphere, instilling caution and wariness among those gathered. The
        students felt a profound awareness of their own behavior and actions,
        conscious of the powerful influence these enigmatic figures held over
        their lives.
      </p>
      <p>NB- Hawks, owls and crows are my favorites.</p>
      <p>
        Under the scorching sun, its rays beating down upon us relentlessly, the
        essence of the preacher's message faded into a hazy blur. The heat
        seemed to draw away our ability to retain the specifics of his words,
        yet there was an undeniable strength in the delivery that left an
        impression. The overarching theme resonated clearly: the importance of
        embracing the new year with open hearts and minds.
      </p>
      <p>
        One observation I've made about Chibase's teachers is their uncanny
        ability to keep talking without knowing when to pause. Their words can
        stretch on endlessly, causing a gradual weariness to settle in, as if
        our legs were growing weaker under the weight of their incessant
        chatter. Despite the mounting chorus of complaints, our words seem to
        fall on deaf ears, continuing their monologue without interruption.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Good morning!” “Good morning!” The man in the brown suit, known to the
        crowd as Tseles, took the microphone and performed his own version of a
        sound check, repeating the phrase "Good morning!" It was as if he wanted
        to ensure that his voice would reach every corner of the assembled
        students, and heaven if possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The teachers, resembling automated machines, positioned themselves
        strategically throughout the crowd. They stood at vantage points, their
        watchful eyes scanning the sea of students, ready to pounce on any sign
        of disrespect that dared to challenge the authority of the roaring lion
        on the stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a commanding presence, Tseles spoke, his words carrying an
        unmistakable weight. "We have returned for 2017, yes, we have returned!"
        Each syllable was emphasized, punctuating the significance of the
        moment. It felt as though his voice had the power to shake the very
        foundation of the gathering, demanding our attention and unwavering
        respect.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the minutes ticked by, it became apparent that Tseles had mastered
        the art of prolonging his address. His words seemed to stretch into
        eternity, while the scorching sun beat down upon us, sapping our
        strength and testing our endurance. Despite the mounting weariness and
        the growing chorus of complaints, the teachers remained stoic, their
        unwavering dedication to discipline shielding them from the rising tide
        of discontent.
      </p>
      <p>
        In those moments, we were reminded that even the smallest challenges,
        such as standing for an extended period, served as humble reminders that
        we shouldn't assume the role of soldiers until we were truly put to the
        test.
      </p>
      <p>
        The passing minutes seemed to stretch into eternity as Tseles continued
        to address the gathering. What started as a few minutes turned into
        five, then ten, and before we knew it, thirty minutes had elapsed. His
        voice seemed to drone on, each new topic introduced with the promise of
        being the "last aspect" or the "last last aspect." We listened intently,
        our patience wearing thin under the scorching sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as with all things, even the most ceaseless speeches must come to an
        end. Finally, Tseles uttered the much-anticipated word, "Disperse!" A
        collective sigh of relief swept through the crowd, as if a weight had
        been lifted from our shoulders. It was a signal that the seemingly
        endless ordeal was finally over.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the word "disperse" reverberated in my ears, a realization dawned
        upon me. It was not just the dispersal of the crowd that Tseles
        commanded, but also a symbolic dispersal of my past self.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the command to disperse, the sea of students began to break apart,
        like a river diverging into multiple streams. The air was filled with a
        mixture of relief and newfound freedom. Conversations sparked to life as
        friends and acquaintances reconnected, exchanging stories of endurance
        and shared impatience.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we dispersed, I couldn't help but reflect on the ebb and flow of
        time. Even the most loquacious of speakers must yield to its unyielding
        march. No matter how long the speech or how endless the monologue,
        eventually, rivers run dry, and words find their end.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amidst the buzz of excitement and anticipation, the time had come for
        us, the newbies, the rookies, the novices, to make a crucial decision:
        to choose our class. Eight classes stood before us, each with its own
        reputation and allure. Among them, the A class stood out like a shining
        beacon, but it carried an air of exclusivity and mystery. It was
        rumoured that only the most exceptional students could thrive in its
        demanding environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whispers circulated through the crowd, cautioning against venturing into
        the territory of the A class. It was said to be a realm reserved for the
        intellectual elites, where rigorous academic challenges awaited those
        who dared to enter. The allure of the B class, with its slightly more
        relaxed reputation, beckoned to me. It seemed like a reasonable choice,
        a path that promised a balance between academic growth and social
        engagement.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as I pondered my decision, a thought struck me. This might be
        my only opportunity to experience the A class.
      </p>
      <p>
        The die was cast, I was an A student, and this too I came to regret.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, my brother Gope, true to his unpredictable nature, opted for
        the C class. It was his own unique choice, perhaps driven by his own set
        of reasons and preferences. The divergence in our decisions highlighted
        the individuality of our paths, each leading to different experiences
        and opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sitting in the class alongside approximately ten other students, I
        couldn't help but notice the distinct lack of enthusiasm among my peers
        who had also chosen the A class. It seemed as though the weight of
        expectation and the fear of failure loomed heavily over us. We were all
        well aware that being part of the A class meant being held to a higher
        standard, and the pressure to maintain that level of excellence was
        palpable.
      </p>
      <p>
        It struck me then that humans have an inherent fear of falling from
        great heights, both metaphorically and literally. We often prefer to
        settle for a comfortable position, even if it means sacrificing the
        potential for greater achievements. It's a natural instinct to protect
        what we have, to avoid the risk of losing the status and recognition
        we've worked so hard to attain.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the context of the class hierarchy, the fear of dropping from the
        highest rank was particularly strong. We were willing to accept a lesser
        position, level 50, rather than risking the possibility of plummeting
        from the top, from level 100, to a mere level 60. It was a calculated
        decision, driven by the fear of failure and the desire to maintain our
        perceived standing among our peers.
      </p>
      <p>
        As my gaze wandered through the crowd, my eyes locked with a pair that
        seemed to be fixed on me. It was one of those moments where time seemed
        to freeze, and instinctively, I held their gaze without flinching. In
        situations like these, there's an unspoken rule that you must show your
        strength and refusal to back down, lest you become an easy target for
        bullying.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as I continued to stare back, my initial resolve began to waver. It
        became clear to me that the person on the other end was a girl, as
        evident from her appearance. In that moment, my thoughts shifted, and a
        sense of confidence surged within me. I couldn't fathom the idea of
        being bullied by a girl, regardless of whether I met her gaze or not. It
        seemed inconceivable that I would allow myself to be intimidated or
        dominated in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pfunzo, the name that carried the weight of education or lessons,
        resonated with me as I learned its English translation. She became more
        than just a name, but a symbol of warmth and kindness in the midst of a
        new and unfamiliar environment. It was a simple smile, but one that held
        profound significance for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the chapters of my life leading up to this point, my experiences had
        been marred by curses, bullying, and mistreatment. It seemed as though
        the world had been unkind, and I carried the scars of those experiences
        within me. In the midst of such turmoil, those who extended gestures of
        kindness stood out like beacons of hope. They created a flicker of light
        amidst the darkness, reminding me that compassion and empathy still
        existed, even in the most challenging of circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though Pfunzo may only make this fleeting appearance within the pages of
        this narrative, her significance goes far beyond that. She occupies a
        special place within the chambers of my heart, the part that receives
        oxygenated blood—the life force that sustains and nourishes. In a world
        that sometimes feels cold and indifferent, it is the remembrance of
        those who showed compassion that provides warmth and fuels my journey
        forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I continued my scan, my intention of finding a potential best friend
        lingered in the back of my mind. Yet, I couldn't help but be conscious
        of the societal expectations and stereotypes that often accompanied such
        connections. Being an African child, there were certain unwritten rules
        and perceptions that dictated who I could befriend and how my
        relationships would be perceived.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fear of being labelled as "friend-zoned" or even worse, facing the
        accusation of being gay, added an additional layer of complexity to the
        process of seeking companionship. It was a delicate balancing act, as I
        wanted to forge genuine connections without inviting unnecessary
        scrutiny or judgment from others, particularly my parents.
      </p>
      <p>
        As my scan of the classroom continued, my attention was drawn to another
        pair of eyes—Man Thendy. However, it wasn't long before I discovered
        that his initial perception of me was skewed. Perhaps it was my face or
        the absence of prominent muscles that led him to mistake my gender. This
        misconception seemed to be a common occurrence, as many people made
        similar assumptions upon our first encounters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Undoubtedly, it goes without saying that having a mere 10 learners in a
        class is highly unconventional, unless we're referring to some affluent
        private institution in a developed nation. However, my expectations were
        swiftly shattered as a flood of teachers entered the room, ushering in
        approximately 60 additional students. That's right, a staggering total
        of around 70 learners per class. If you find this revelation
        astonishing, then I must admit that I neglected to acquaint you with a
        vital detail about the school.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chibase Secondary School (CSS) proudly stood as one of the prestigious
        institutions in the Bembe East District, among the revered "big three"
        schools alongside Thengwe and Mbilwi. In South Africa, schools are
        classified into quintiles, a system that ranks them based on their
        socio-economic conditions and available resources. With five quintile
        ranks, ranging from the most disadvantaged to the most well-resourced,
        Chibase found itself situated in quintile 2, while Thengwe and Mbilwi
        occupied quintiles 3 and 4 respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        The quintile system provided a broader understanding of the educational
        landscape, shedding light on the challenges faced by schools in
        different socio-economic contexts. Quintile 1 schools, designated as the
        most economically disadvantaged, often grappled with limited resources
        and inadequate infrastructure. In contrast, quintile 5 schools enjoyed
        ample resources and additional support, creating an environment
        conducive to quality education.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chibase's placement in quintile 2 reflected its intermediate position
        within the spectrum. While not as financially constrained as quintile 1
        schools, it still faced significant challenges in meeting the demands of
        its student population. The shortage of classrooms was a prevailing
        issue, which, in turn, resulted in larger class sizes. Therefore, the
        sight of approximately 70 students per class became a norm rather than
        an anomaly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question of why I chose Chibase Secondary School is not one that
        rests solely on my shoulders. It is a question that delves into the
        collective choices and experiences of my family members who came before
        me. To truly understand the reasons behind this decision, one would have
        to seek the insights of my older sister, who paved the way, or my older
        brother, who followed suit, or any of my other brothers who also walked
        the halls of Chibase. For me, it was simply a matter of following the
        established pattern. Sometimes, conformity to established norms
        outweighs the desire to be an outlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I were to venture beyond the confines of patterns and personal
        influence, I might have chosen Mbilwi instead. It is situated much
        closer to my home and boasts a position among the esteemed "big three"
        schools. Moreover, Mbilwi holds the distinction of having the highest
        quintile ranking among these three schools. The allure of proximity,
        prestige, and ample resources would have made Mbilwi an attractive
        choice had I been free from the predetermined path.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, should you redirect your inquiry towards why individuals, in
        general, choose Chibase, the answer becomes clearer. Chibase Secondary
        School has garnered a reputation for housing some of the finest
        educators in the country. These dedicated teachers have contributed to
        the school's success and have played an instrumental role in shaping the
        academic achievements of their students. Additionally, Chibase owes its
        prominence to the exceptional individuals who have left an indelible
        mark on its legacy. Figures like Ndou Ntsundeni, known for his
        impressive course achievements, Bambela Takalani, renowned for his
        mathematical prowess, and Mashapha Fulufhelani, celebrated for her
        exceptional intelligence, have elevated the school's standing. While
        these names represent only a fraction of the notable individuals
        associated with Chibase, delving into each would require a considerable
        amount of time and space. For those curious about the individuals I
        mentioned, a quick search engine query would offer a more comprehensive
        understanding of their contributions.

      <p>
        Indeed, with 70 students per class and only 3 students sharing 2 desks,
        there was an evident scarcity of personal space. It was a crowded
        environment, and as the seating arrangements were being sorted out, the
        air was filled with a sense of anticipation and a flurry of social
        dynamics. As the students deliberated on where and with whom to sit,
        cliques and groups formed naturally. Those who had attended Bufuli
        Primary School found solace in the company of familiar faces,
        gravitating towards one another. Meanwhile, I found myself in a
        different situation, being alone and seeking out conversations that
        piqued my interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        I approached various squads, trying to draw near and catch snippets of
        conversations that intrigued me. It was an attempt to find a connection
        amidst the sea of unfamiliar faces and establish a sense of belonging.
        Each interaction held the potential to uncover common interests, forge
        new friendships, and perhaps alleviate the feeling of isolation.
      </p>
      <p>
        That fateful day, amidst the bustling crowd and the cacophony of voices,
        I encountered a person who would become an integral part of my
        journey—an unexpected co-protagonist in the unfolding chapters of my
        life. His name was Man Mukha, a unique individual who would eventually
        prove to be one of my most formidable opponents.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a world where language serves as the bridge between individuals, we
        often gravitate towards those who share a common linguistic landscape.
        But Man Mukha was different. He didn't speak the languages of art,
        anime, or Japan—the realms that captivated my imagination. Instead, he
        possessed fluency in a language that resonated deeply with me—the
        language of theories, principles, laws, energies, vibrations, and
        matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        While others might engage in conversations about celebrity scandals or
        popular culture, Man Mukha delved into the depths of profound ideas and
        intellectual pursuits. He understood the beauty of unraveling mysteries,
        exploring the intricacies of the universe, and dissecting the enigmatic
        phenomena that intrigued our curious minds. It was through this shared
        language of scientific inquiry and philosophical contemplation that we
        found a profound connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his company, I discovered a companion who could engage in profound
        discussions about the mysteries of the Bermuda Triangle, the
        complexities of quantum mechanics, or the hidden forces that shape our
        existence. We immersed ourselves in a world of conjectures, hypotheses,
        and spirited debates—unleashing the power of our minds to unravel the
        secrets that lay before us.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Man Mukha by my side, our conversations became a tapestry woven
        with intellectual curiosity, challenging me to expand my perspectives,
        question my assumptions, and venture into uncharted territories of
        thought. While others may have found solace in more conventional topics,
        it was the language of theories and ideas that truly stirred our souls.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, when you come to me, don't expect trivial gossip or superficial
        tales of entertainment. Instead, present me with your theories, your
        musings on the unexplained, and the depths of your intellectual prowess.
        For in that realm, I will meet you with open arms, ready to delve into
        the wonders of the universe and share a drink in celebration of our
        shared passion for knowledge and the mysteries that lie beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me make one thing clear right off the bat: I am a bona fide nerd,
        plain and simple. My primary school days were consumed by a voracious
        appetite for science books and an insatiable curiosity for all things
        intriguing. I devoured the tales of Greek mythology long before they
        graced the screens of my television. Proverbs and idioms were my
        playground, and I reveled in unraveling their origins. As for the Bible,
        I pored over its pages, seeking the wisdom concealed within its
        parables.
      </p>
      <p>
        In approximately a year's time, the much-anticipated God of War 4 will
        be unleashed upon the world. And there's a quote from Mimir, a character
        in the game, that resonates deeply with me: "Me? I'm the greatest
        ambassador to the gods, the giants, and all the creatures of the nine
        realms. I know every corner of these lands, every language spoken, every
        war waged, every deal struck. They call me Mimir, the smartest man
        alive, and I have the answer to your every question." It encapsulates
        the unwavering confidence I possess in my knowledge of various
        mythologies—whether it be Greek, Roman, Norse, Japanese, or Egyptian.
        Consider me a walking encyclopedia of the gods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back in my primary school days, I wore the crown of the top student with
        pride. But let me tell you what my mom's friend warned me about
        secondary school: it's a whole new ballgame. I was told to brace myself
        for encounters with individuals far surpassing me in intellect and
        talent. Beasts, monsters, gods, geniuses, memory cards, and
        bookworms—the whole shebang. Secondary school is where the real players
        come out to shine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Was I initially afraid of plummeting from the pinnacle of achievement?
        Undoubtedly, the thought instilled a sense of unease within me. However,
        as the sun rose this morning, a newfound realization dawned upon me:
        shedding my former identity was a blessing in disguise. From this day
        forth, the boy who once adorned the crown of academic excellence is but
        a mere shadow. Today, I embrace a different role—I am an observer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this realm of observation, I stumbled upon a kindred spirit, a
        bookworm like myself, who would become my closest companion in this vast
        landscape of secondary school. Together, we delved into the depths of
        knowledge, sharing our love for literature and unearthing hidden gems
        within the pages of countless books. Additionally, I encountered two
        other individuals who spoke the language of art, forming a trio of
        creative souls bound by shared passions. Alas, their significance in the
        grand tapestry of my story would prove to be fleeting. Nevertheless, it
        was during those moments of connection that I witnessed artistry that
        far surpassed my own, a humbling reminder of the boundless talents that
        existed beyond my own realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amongst the commotion, a group of teachers descended upon us, counting
        heads and reorganizing the classroom. Their presence carried a certain
        weight, with some even issuing veiled warnings of a significant
        reduction in our numbers by the start of the second term. Whether it was
        a threat or a looming reality, the uncertainty hung in the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then he entered the room—the best of the best, the crème de la
        crème, the Veteran. Approaching retirement age, he still held the
        reputation of being the finest science teacher around.
      </p>
      <p>
        His arrival commanded attention. There was an air of authority and
        wisdom about him. When he spoke, his voice resonated with the richness
        of experience, captivating our minds. He possessed a deep understanding
        of the subject, acquired through years of dedicated teaching and
        exploration.
      </p>
      <p>
        No rookie is meant to appear cool; we're all supposed to look weak,
        uncool, and easy targets for bullying. That's what I believed until I
        crossed paths with a guy named Leon Kobas. This dude was born cool, from
        head to toe. Perfect height, complexion, and style. I just knew he would
        be the one to attract the hottest girl in our class. And I was damn
        right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leon Kobas had it all. He oozed confidence and charm effortlessly. He
        had that magnetic aura that drew people in, especially the ladies. It
        seemed like he had a natural ability to capture the attention of the
        most desirable girls without even trying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, there I was, marching to the beat of my own drum. I was the
        nerd type, more interested in books and knowledge than in chasing after
        girls. But damn, I couldn't help but notice the allure of Leon Kobas. He
        was the epitome of coolness, breaking away from the crowd and standing
        out with his unique charisma.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of my day unfolded in a mundane and uneventful manner. It was
        one of those days where nothing seemed to capture my interest or ignite
        any excitement within me. It felt like the hours dragged on, each moment
        blending into the next with a monotonous rhythm. To spare you the
        details of the trivialities that filled the remainder of my school day,
        let's fast forward to the moment I walked out of the school gate. As I
        stepped outside, I felt a sense of relief wash over me, signalling the
