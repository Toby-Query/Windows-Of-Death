        If I were to reveal the naked truth, nobody would believe me. It would
        be no different from standing on the summit of Mount Everest and
        proclaiming to the world that Santa Claus is real. I might as well add
        that he rides dragons to Olympus. I wouldn't believe myself either.
        Nowadays, people aren't as gullible as their ancestors. Speaking the
        unvarnished truth could land you in a mental institution at best, and at
        worst, facing a fate of fire and stone. Yet, someone must know. Someone
        must help.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was on Monday, the 16th of January 2017, that I experienced the most
        bizarre experience that can be thrust upon a 13-year-old boy. It was to
        be my first day at the renowned Chibase Secondary School (CSS). The
        night before, excitement had kept me reluctant to sleep, but alas, sleep
        holds dominion over the weary minds of boys. And so, somehow, I
        succumbed to slumber, only to awaken in an entirely different realm. I
        found myself still within the confines of my own room, dispelling any
        notion of being transported to some fantastical isekai world. If that
        were the case, I suppose a conventional truck accident would have
        sufficed. Ah, the undeniable truth of my otaku nature, proclaiming my
        fervent love for all things anime.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I was saying, my awakening unveiled an eerie scene. My room had
        become inhabited by peculiar beings—women, to be more precise. The lack
        of curtains on my window exposed me to their presence, and it just so
        happened to coincide with that time of the month, the time when wolves
        are supposed to be howling in response to the untainted light of the
        perfectly lit full moon.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        I rubbed my eyes, convinced that I must still be trapped within the
        remnants of a dream. But no, as my vision sharpened, the figures came
        into focus—strange women with an air of mystery surrounding them. Their
        appearance was not what one would expect from ordinary inhabitants of
        this world. They emanated an otherworldly aura, an ethereal beauty that
        captivated my senses.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Curiosity mingled with apprehension as I observed them, trying to
        comprehend their presence in my humble abode. Their attire was both
        elegant and archaic, adorned with intricate patterns and vibrant colors
        that seemed to defy the fashion trends of our time. Each woman possessed
        an individuality that was both enchanting and unsettling, as if they had
        stepped out of a long-forgotten storybook.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, it was their eyes that held the greatest intrigue, mirroring the
        beauty of the moon. Their gazes, intense and penetrating, seemed to
        delve into the depths of my soul.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        "He's here. They are not safe," whispered the woman by the window, her
        silver hair cascading over her shoulders. Her face bore an expression
        that seemed to embrace the mysteries of the night.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Why, though? Why target children? What does he want from them?"
        questioned an older-looking woman seated at the far end of my sofa, her
        attire mirroring the other women in the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This has never happened before. What are we to do?" added a voice,
        belonging to a woman who remained out of my field of vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        A different voice chimed in, filled with disappointment. "There is
        nothing we can do."
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the scene that greeted me as I awoke, the unfamiliar voices of
        women permeating my room. Though I could only see two of them, I sensed
        that there were at least four present, judging from their ongoing
        discussion. In all my years, I had feared darkness, snakes, scorpions,
        and various other creatures, but never had I experienced true fear until
        that moment. If fear is to be swimming in the deepest oceanic trench,
        then the best I’ve done is bathe in a bathtub. Today I felt fear. It was
        as if the weight of the entire ocean pressed against my chest, rendering
        my body immobile. When you command your body to move, and it stubbornly
        refuses, you know it's fear. In my case, it was a combination of fear
        and sleep paralysis, probably a defense mechanism my body activated in
        that unsettling moment. Or perhaps, as my superstitious friends would
        believe, it was the work of witches. Ah, my old friends, always quick to
        attribute the unexplainable to the supernatural.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you may have already noticed, I will be weaving between past and
        present tense throughout this narrative. It is a reflection of the
        disorienting nature of my experience, the blurred lines between reality
        and the unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that crucial moment, time seemed to hang suspended, the air pregnant
        with anticipation. I found myself teetering on the precipice of
        understanding, yearning for answers to the myriad of questions swirling
        within me. Who were these women? Why are they here?
      </p>
      <p>
        In the realm of my imagination, I fancy myself a scientist—a luminary on
        par with the great minds of Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking. As a
        scientist, my duty is to observe the world around me, to analyze, and to
        formulate hypotheses. In that moment, as I lay amidst those
        extraordinary women, a hypothesis took shape in my mind. I found myself
        daring to believe in the existence of witches, beings of a high order
        that I had never truly contemplated before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Flexibility and gullibility are the difference between a scientist and a
        wannabe. Flexibility is by conclusion; gullibility is by blind belief.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be a scientist requires both flexibility and a healthy dose of
        skepticism. Flexibility enables one to adapt and embrace new
        possibilities, while skepticism acts as a safeguard against blind
        belief. I had always prided myself on my capacity for flexibility, but
        the concept of witches had remained firmly in the realm of fairy tales
        and folklore. Now, faced with this inexplicable encounter, my scientific
        mind grappled with the collision of my preconceived notions and the
        extraordinary reality that unfolded before me.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the stillness of my paralyzed state, a flicker of hope ignited within
        the witch standing by the window. “Perhaps there is something that can
        be done,” her name, Jessica, resonated in the air as the others turned
        their attention towards her, eager to grasp onto any glimmer of
        possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What do you mean, Jessica?" questioned one of the witches, her voice
        laced with a mixture of curiosity and skepticism.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The boy, he can see us, can’t you?” With measured steps, Jessica
        approached me, her movements graceful and deliberate. There was an
        otherworldly aura about her, as if she existed outside the realms of
        conventional understanding. She lacked a discernible scent, and her
        presence seemed to have no tangible influence on the environment around
        her. As the other witches shifted into my line of sight, their gazes
        fixed upon me, I couldn't help but feel a sense of intrigue mingled with
        trepidation. Contrary to my initial assumptions, their stares betrayed
        no malice nor darkness. Instead, I detected a hint of desperation,
        quickly replaced by a glimmer of relief.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drawing closer, Jessica extended her hand, gently placing it upon my
        left ear. It was a gesture akin to a mother comforting her child, a
        touch that conveyed both tenderness and urgency.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Child," she began, her voice carrying a weight of importance, "we need
        your hel..."
      </p>
      <p>
        Before her words could fully register in my mind, I blinked, and in that
        brief moment, the witches vanished from my sight. The sleep paralysis
        remained, an eerie residue of their presence that clung to my
        immobilized form.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within a fleeting 30-second time frame, my alarm blared to life, jolting
        me out of my paralyzed state. With a swift movement, I silenced the
        intrusive sound, an annoyance that always seemed to snatch me away from
        the climactic moments of my dreams. As I sat on the edge of my bed,
        surrounded by darkness, I couldn't help but ponder the extraordinary
        events that had unfolded just moments ago. Waking up to the presence of
        witches surpassed any fears I had held before, even the dreaded
        encounter with a snake paled in comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
        But so what? I reminded myself that the god I fervently believed in was
        far greater than a mere handful of witches. It was a lesson instilled in
        me by my mother, a beacon of wisdom and faith. When faced with terror
        and the absence of aid, she always taught me to remember that God held
        the power to terrify the very thing that frightened me, and that he was
        merely a prayer away. And so, with conviction burning within me, I knelt
        on the floor, ready to seek solace in prayer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I rose from my bed, knowing that the day ahead held its own unique set
        of challenges. As I surveyed the disheveled state of my room, the
        thought of making my bed seemed utterly pointless. Who cared about
        neatly arranged sheets and meticulously polished shoes? The great men of
        history didn't concern themselves with such trivialities. They lived and
        made their mark on the world long before the invention of perfectly
        tucked sheets and gleaming shoe polish, and their legacies will endure
        long after the demise of these modern-day conveniences.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, my morning routine was far from glamorous. Being the
        unfortunate one among my two brothers, we shared the same bathtub for
        our morning rituals. It was a chaotic dance of timing and negotiation,
        where every second mattered in securing a few moments of warm water. The
        concept of personal space was a luxury I couldn't afford.
      </p>
      <p>
        And speaking of brothers, let me clarify something. When I say
        "brothers," they may not necessarily be biological siblings. In the
        realm of family relationships, I am utterly lost. Cousin, uncle, aunt,
        niece, mother-in-law—all these terms are like a foreign language to me.
        I am well-versed in the basics: sister, brother, mother, and father.
        Beyond that, the intricacies of extended family connections are a
        mystery to me, like the enigmatic complexities of the Greek language.
      </p>
      <p>
         4 am, I wake up  Take a 20-minute bathe  Don on my new uniform  My
        brothers wake up, 4:30 and 5:00 by age.
      </p>
      <p>
        I couldn't help but appreciate the scent of new clothes that lingered in
        the air. However, despite my fondness for that scent, I couldn't muster
        the same enthusiasm for uniforms themselves. They represented order and
        equality, a homogeneity that clashed with my own inclination towards
        chaos and the advantages that inequality sometimes brought. But rules
        were rules, and as I tightened the buttons and adjusted the collar, I
        resigned myself to conforming to the expected standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I delve further into my own journey, allow me to introduce my
        brothers. First, there is Gope, a mere month apart from me in age. He
        often walks in the shadow of our eldest brother, Rasikhinkha. Gope has a
        way of imitating Rasikhinkha's mannerisms, seamlessly blending into his
        world. But despite his efforts, we remain distinct individuals, each
        with our own unique experiences and perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rasikhinkha, the eldest of us all at 17, carries an air of confidence
        and authority. He embodies the ideals of the older sibling. While Gope
        may strive to emulate Rasikhinkha, the truth is that our individuality
        cannot be erased. We each have our own paths to forge, our own destinies
        to fulfill.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I stood before the expansive mirror in my mom's bathroom, I couldn't
        resist the urge to flex, admiring my own reflection with a mixture of
        confidence and amusement. It was a habit I had developed over time, a
        momentary indulgence in self-assuredness. As I struck a pose, my eyes
        wandered to the corner of the room where my mom engaged in a heated
        discussion with my oldest brother.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their voices carried through the slightly ajar door, revealing glimpses
        of their ongoing dispute over money. It was a familiar scene, one that
        played out regularly in our household. My mom, ever the vigilant
        guardian of our finances, was convinced that my brother was seeking more
        funds than he truly needed. A battle of wills ensued, as each tried to
        outmanoeuvre the other, a game where the stakes were not only monetary
        but also a test of patience and determination.
      </p>
      <p>
        The clock struck 5:30, and as the hands ticked forward, signaling the
        passage of time, we made our way through the kitchen door. The cool
        morning breeze caressed my face, carrying with it a sense of
        anticipation and possibility. In that moment, I recognized that a new
        chapter of my life was about to unfold. Life had presented me with a
        challenge, an opportunity for growth and self-discovery. And with each
        step I took forward, I accepted that challenge with my head held high.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the grand scheme of things, I saw myself as a player among billions,
        competing to conquer the challenges that life threw our way. It was a
        game where the best and brightest rose to the occasion, displaying their
        resilience, adaptability, and unwavering determination. And in this game
        of life, I saw myself as an SSS-rank player, a classification reserved
        for the elite, those who excelled in tackling the obstacles that stood
        in their path.
