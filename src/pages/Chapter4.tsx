      <h1>Chapter 4: Matters of Religion</h1>
      <p>
        In the tapestry of teenage life, it is almost customary to delve into
        matters of religion, along with sex, drugs, and depression. While my
        personal experiences may not be extensive, I feel compelled to share my
        thoughts on this intricate subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do I believe in God? The answer is an affirmative one. I hold faith in
        the existence of the one true God, the deity revered by the followers of
        Abraham, Moses, and countless others. To me, this God is not a stagnant
        entity but rather one that evolves alongside humanity, adapting to the
        changing needs and understanding of its creations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The foundation of my beliefs can be traced back to the influence of my
        mother and a fellow student I met at my new school, a remarkable young
        girl named Saint. It was through her that I gained insights into the
        Christian faith. Saint introduced me to the concept of the Christian
        God, who is viewed as a trinity comprising God the Father, God the Son,
        and God the Holy Spirit. This triune nature gives rise to a distinct
        timeline within the Christian religion, encompassing three distinct
        parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Old Testament marks the first timeline in the Christian faith, a
        period governed by God the Father, an incredibly strict and deeply
        involved deity. In deference to Saint's preference, I will use a capital
        "G" for God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, I must admit that I would not find it desirable to live
        during this era. I have always harboured reservations towards
        individuals who exhibit excessive strictness, which may stem from a
        profound emotional response within me. The Old Testament recounts
        numerous events that, by conventional standards, would be deemed
        extraordinary: the parting of seas, the destruction of entire cities,
        and other extraordinary interventions. Such interventions were a
        testament to God's intense involvement with humanity during this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as the pages turned, a shift occurred, and a new divine
        presence emerged.
      </p>
      <p>
        The New Testament ushers in an era characterized by mercy and
        compassion, with Jesus Christ as the central figure. He is regarded as
        the Messiah, embodying the love that God has for the world. In him, the
        Father is revealed, and he imparts crucial messages to humanity. Above
        all, his teachings emphasize the importance of loving God and loving
        one's neighbours profoundly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus redefined many beliefs that had become burdensome and hindered the
        progress of mankind. He emphasized that it is not what goes into a
        person's mouth that matters, but rather what comes out of it. He
        highlighted the remarkable power of faith, no matter how small it may
        be. Throughout his life, Jesus fulfilled numerous prophecies, and
        ultimately, mankind crucified God on a cross. This act became a powerful
        symbol of God's capacity to forgive and offer second and third chances.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this reign, although brief, also came to an end. What remained
        were two fundamental elements: the name of the Messiah and the presence
        of our new God, God the Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the current era, we find ourselves in the presence of a lesser-known
        God, yet one who governs the times we live in. This God is the spirit of
        God, empowering humanity to rule the world, as it was originally
        intended. The overt involvement of God in human affairs has become less
        evident, leading to doubt and questioning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mankind has been bestowed with everything necessary to propel itself
        forward and govern its own destiny. We have reached a point where we
        have created a sense of unity among all people through an entirely
        distinct religion—the religion of humanity. This religion transcends
        specific faiths such as Christianity or Buddhism. It recognizes humanity
        itself as the one true religion.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the fundamental principles that hold true both in heaven and on
        earth is the significance of humanity. It forms the cornerstone of
        objective morality, while everything else falls under the realm of
        subjective morality. Recognizing and honouring the value of humanity is
        at the core of our collective responsibility and moral compass.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, let us delve into the thought-provoking questions that arise when
        considering matters of faith. Am I a Christian? In a strict definition,
        yes, I believe in Christ. However, when it comes to identifying with a
        specific religious label, I find myself aligning more with the broader
        essence of humanity. I see myself as a human, embracing the
        interconnectedness and shared experiences that unite us all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Turning our attention to the symbolism of the cross, what does it
        represent to me personally? Is it a symbol of God's love for the world,
        a symbol of mercy, or does it hold no significance at all? To be honest,
        the cross holds little meaning in my life. I did not have the privilege
        of walking alongside Christ or witnessing the profound impact of his
        sacrifice firsthand. While I recognize the deep emotional resonance it
        carries for those who lived during that time, I cannot fully comprehend
        or replicate their intense connection to the cross.
      </p>
      <p>
        For me, the concept of God takes on a different meaning, and I yearned
        for a symbol that encapsulates my own unique understanding of the
        divine. Thus, I embarked on creating my own symbol for God, one that
        resonates with my personal journey and spiritual beliefs. This symbol
        serves as a visual representation of how I perceive and connect with the
        divine forces that shape my existence. It allows me to express my
        individual perspective on God, reflecting the depths of my own spiritual
        exploration.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my symbol for God, the design incorporates various elements that hold
        personal significance to me. At the top, there is an orb representing
        the Father, the ultimate source of divine wisdom and guidance. The
        flowing lines connecting the orbs symbolize the continuous reign and
        influence of God throughout different periods of history.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two orbs below represent the Son and the Holy Spirit, representing
        the divine manifestations of God's presence in the world. They serve as
        reminders of the transformative power and grace that can be found in the
        Christian narrative. Within the symbol, there are four short
        perpendicular lines, each representing a different aspect of my personal
        values in life. However, the long central line holds the utmost
        importance as it represents the fundamental law of heaven: love. Love is
        the timeless and unchanging essence of God's nature, the guiding
        principle that transcends any shifting values or beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is worth noting that the meaning of each of the four lines
        representing personal values may evolve and change over time, reflecting
        the dynamic nature of human growth and self-discovery. This aspect of
        the symbol emphasizes my belief in a God who evolves with the changing
        times, while upholding the eternal and unwavering love that God has for
        all of humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, my self-created symbol for God represents a personal
        interpretation of divinity, incorporating elements of evolution, love,
        and the exploration of one's values in the journey of faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding science, I hold a firm belief in its validity and
        significance. Science, in my perspective, is a tool that allows humans
        to explore and understand the natural world. It is a product of the
        intricate workings of God's creation, providing us with a means to
        uncover the mysteries of the universe. I share the viewpoint that God
        does not create things multiple times but rather establishes a
        foundation upon which scientific principles operate. Through scientific
        inquiry, we gain insights into the laws and mechanisms that govern the
        world around us. It is through the study of science that we are able to
        appreciate the intricate complexity and beauty of God's creation. Like
        the Veteran always says, God does not create twice.
      </p>
      <p>
        He created things once and everything after that was pure science
        subjected to pure nonsensical interpretations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Saint, the girl I met at the YCM (Youth Church……something), made a
        profound impact on me. The YCM was a religious gathering that took place
        during school breaks, resembling a church-like event. Attending was a
        matter of personal choice, whether out of a sense of obligation or a
        genuine desire to be there. In my case, I attended because I felt it was
        expected of me, but for Saint, it was a different story.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I observed her at the front, fully immersed in praise and worship, it
        was evident that she had a deep connection with her faith. She didn't
        care about the eyes watching her or the judgments that might arise. It
        was a personal communion between her and her God, a moment of pure
        devotion and conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that encounter, I glimpsed the essence of Christianity through Saint.
        She embodied the heart of the religion, showcasing unwavering faith,
        authenticity, and an unshakeable connection with her beliefs. It was a
        powerful reminder that religion is not just about rituals or external
        appearances, but about the intimate relationship one cultivates with
        their spiritual path.
      </p>
      <p>
        I couldn't help but feel drawn to Saint, compelled to approach her and
        engage in a conversation that would unravel her deep-rooted beliefs.
        Perhaps it was my own longing to have the same level of conviction, or
        maybe I was simply intrigued by her story.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we spoke, Saint's words resonated with a profound knowledge of God
        and scripture. She effortlessly recited verses and questioned my own
        beliefs, challenging me to examine the foundations of my faith. Every
        response she offered seemed meticulously crafted, as if it were a
        perfectly rehearsed script.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a certain allure in her ability to communicate with such
        clarity and precision. It was as if she possessed a gift for delivering
        flawless speeches, leaving those who listened in awe of her words. I
        admired her unwavering commitment to her beliefs, the certainty with
        which she expressed herself. It was a reminder of the power of
        deep-rooted faith and the impact it can have on one's speech and
        presence.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the presence of Saint, it felt as though I was engaging in a dialogue
        straight from the pages of the Bible itself. Her unwavering devotion to
        God's teachings was evident in every word she spoke. There was no room
        for doubt or hesitation in her discourse. It was a remarkable quality,
        one that commanded attention and respect.
      </p>
      <p>
        I liked that about her, the idea of having perfect speech. A speech so
        perfect that the person you are talking to will think that every reply
        you give is premeditated, a script for a movie or so.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Iron sharpens iron, and one person sharpens another.” Proverbs 27:17
      </p>
      <p>
        Through my growing friendship with Saint, I discovered a treasure that
        would become my favorite book—the Proverbs. It was a collection of
        timeless wisdom and practical guidance that resonated deeply within me.
        As I delved into its pages, I found solace in the profound insights and
        life lessons it offered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within its pages, I found wisdom that transcended time and culture. The
        Proverbs were not confined to any specific religious doctrine but spoke
        to the universal principles that govern human existence. Each proverb
        was like a precious gem, shining with truth and providing guidance for
        navigating the intricacies of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Saint's guidance, I embarked on a journey to reconnect with my
        father, who, unfortunately, wasn't known for his conversational skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I delved deeper into Saint's life, I discovered that she chose to be
        a B student. Despite possessing exceptional intellect and capabilities,
        she purposefully aimed for a lower grade class. I guess you can say she
        pulled that Ayanokoji move.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like Ayanokoji, she had her own story to tell. A 13-year can’t be
        that great of a Christian with no sad story behind it, as an observer,
        it’s my duty to know every background story. I sticked around until I
        was trusted, until I was a friend.
      </p>
      <p>In her words, I did my best and God did the rest.</p>
