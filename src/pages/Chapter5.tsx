      <p>
        I have some time to kill, so letâ€™s look at the grading system and all
        that.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a grade 8 student, I had to study nine different subjects, each with
        its own passing requirements. But I didn't really care about the minimum
        percentages needed to pass, I was not going get low enough to care. To
        me it was more of a question of how much I need for level 7 and 6. To
        those unfamiliar with levels, just assume that 7 is A and 6 is B. If you
        are Asian, just assume 7 is D-plus, 6 is D-minus.

        1. Mathematics: The second most challenging subject among the nine. I
        never fully grasped the difficulty of math until I reached grade 8. I
        naively believed that it would become easier with the introduction of
        calculators (apologies to the Asians). I used to criticize Raskhinkha
        for struggling with math when he had a calculator at his disposal. But
        my days of judgment came to an abrupt halt, as I found myself sitting in
        the defendant's seat. I, like Jesus, wept.

        2. Tshivenda Home Language: According to Galileo Galilei, Mathematics is
        the language in which God has written the universe. In my opinion,
        that's because even God couldn't fathom writing the universe in my home
        language. Allow me to introduce you to the most challenging subject
        among the nine. It may sound like common knowledge, but it's far from
        it. Tshivenda is only easy for those who have already reached advanced
        years. The younger generation knows very little, and the youngest ones
        struggle even more. It's not that the language is dying; it's just that
        certain aspects were never necessary to begin with.
